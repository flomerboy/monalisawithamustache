			<h1> Artist Statement </h1>
			<p> This is my first collaboration with
renaissance painter Leonardo DaVinci, and actor Charlie Chaplin.
Collaborating with these two has been very enjoyable for us both and I
am currently accepting offers for collaboration from other prominent
artists. You can send proposals to hello@ryanflomerfelt.com </p>
